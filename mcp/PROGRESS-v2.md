# E-Commerce Golang Backend - Development Progress

## **Overall Progress Summary**

**Current Status:** ✅ **All Layers Implemented (Pending Verification)**

All layers of the application have been implemented according to the architectural rules. The code is feature-complete but requires thorough testing and verification to ensure all components work together correctly.

-   **✅ Phase 1: Skeletal Layer** - **COMPLETED**
-   **✅ Phase 2: Contract Layer** - **COMPLETED**
-   **✅ Phase 3: Data Access Layer (Repository)** - **COMPLETED**
-   **✅ Phase 4: Business Logic Layer (Service)** - **COMPLETED (unchecked)**
-   **✅ Phase 5: API/Presentation Layer** - **COMPLETED (unchecked)**
-   **✅ Phase 6: Helper/Utility Packages** - **COMPLETED (unchecked)**

## **Next Steps: Verification and Testing**

The next major phase is to verify the correctness of the implemented layers. This includes running the application, performing manual API tests, and writing automated tests.

1.  **Run the application** to ensure it starts without errors.
2.  **Manually test** all API endpoints using a tool like Postman or curl.
3.  **Write unit tests** for service layer business logic.
4.  **Write integration tests** for the API layer.

*Last Updated: All layers implemented. Awaiting verification and testing.*
*Note: any code filename with unclear functionalities (e.g. `internal/utils/utils.go`;`internal/contract/contract.go`, etc)*
*Especially the one inside internal folder, the codefile will be ignored as unused code building blocks, as marked by `/**/` form*
